# Cognitive Base Library

`cognitive_base` is a collection of implementations of processes inspired by cognitive science and cognitive architectures. 
This library aims to facilitate the development of AI agents by providing tools and components that mimic human cognitive processes.

## Features

- **Memory Elements**: Components for storing and retrieving data.
- **Reasoning**: Tools for logical reasoning and decision-making.
- **Learning**: Mechanisms for learning from data and experiences.
- **Retrieval**: Efficient data retrieval methods.
- **Planning**: Tools for creating and executing plans.

## Getting Started

### Installation

TODO: Instructions on how to install the library.

TODO: requirements

### Basic Usage

TODO: Provide a simple example of how to use the library.

## Documentation

## References

Example from the CoALA paper:

> For example, a future coding agent could maintain human-provided programming knowledge (semantic) such as manuals, textbooks, problems, and examples, as well as its problem solutions and test records (episodic), reflections, and summaries on top of these experiences (semantic), and a gradually expanding code library that stores useful methods, e.g., QuickSort, GCD, LCA (procedural).
>
> Similar development is also possible for solving interactive text games, book-level QA, personalized chat, or any task where agents could exploit existing human experiences and explore new ones.

## Roadmap
The library is inspired by various cognitive architectures, including:
- CoALA (Sumers et. al. 2023)
- Soar (various iterations, see [references](https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/home/About/))

We aim to implement more of the features from the above over time
