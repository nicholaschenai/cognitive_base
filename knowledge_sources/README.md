CoALA: "a future coding agent could maintain human-provided programming knowledge (semantic) such as manuals, textbooks, problems, and examples"

This folder provides some tools to parse, transform and upload these sources. We distinguish between knowledge sources and datasets in that the latter is what we associate with "training / val / test set"

Example: USACO-Bench provides textbooks. We include them as examples for uploading knowledge to the CoALA agent.
