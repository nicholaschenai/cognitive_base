Quoting "Enhancing intelligent agents with episodic memory" (Nuxoll & Laird, 2011)

"there are additional functional requirements that Tulving
(1983) identified that distinguish episodic memory from
other memory and learning mechanisms"

- Automatic: agent does not need to decide creating episodic mem. assumptions:
	- deciding to remember can interfere w task based reasoning
	- unlikely that agent can effectively determine which exp will be relevant to future decisions
- AUTONOETIC: retrieved memory distinguished frm current sensing to prevent confusion
- Temporally indexed: as episodic mem describes a unique moment in time, some temporal info is a part of any episodic mem and can be part of episodic cue. does not need to be exact time but at least relative time wrt other episodes
